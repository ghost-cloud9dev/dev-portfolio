# Fat-Burning Heart Rate

> Calculates a person’s optimal fat-burning heart rate based on age, with validation and error handling.

---

## Purpose
This program reads a user’s age, verifies that it falls within a healthy range (18–75), and computes the fat-burning heart rate using the standard formula  
`0.70 × (220 − age)`.  
It was originally designed as a programming exercise to practice input validation, exception handling, and simple numeric computation.

---

##  What It Demonstrates
- Function design with parameters and return values  
- Raising and catching `ValueError` exceptions  
- Use of constants and clear variable naming  
- Clean, user-friendly output formatting

## How to Run
Requires **Python 3.10+**

```bash
python LAB_fat_burning_heart_rate.py
