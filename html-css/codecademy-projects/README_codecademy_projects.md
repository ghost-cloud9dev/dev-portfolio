# HTML/CSS – Codecademy projects

This folder collects a few small HTML/CSS exercises completed during my Codecademy learning path. Each subfolder contains a self‑contained mini‑project with a simple `index.html` and styles.

## Projects Included
- websitedesign_html
- desmoto_html
- cheatsheet_html
- dev_html

## How to Run Locally
Open any project's `index.html` in your browser:
- Finder: double‑click the `index.html` file.
- Terminal:
  ```bash
  open path/to/project/index.html
  ```

*Note:* Projects are intentionally small and focused—intended to demonstrate basic semantic HTML, simple CSS styling, and file layout.
